## :wrench: Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (v16.6.0 or higher)
- Discord Account

### Project Setup

1. Fork or Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Navigate to the project root directory (location of package.json)
3. Run the command `npm install` to install all dependencies
4. Setting up a discord bot application
   - Follow [this guide](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html) on how to set up a new discord application and add a bot
   - Save the `Bot Token`, `Client ID` and `Client Secret` to a new file named `.env` in the project root directory

Example `.env` file content:

```html
DC_BOT_TOKEN=<your bot token>
DC_BOT_CLIENT_ID=<your application client id>
DC_BOT_CLIENT_SECRET=<your application client secret>
DC_BOT_PERMISSIONS=274878131264
```

## :rocket: How to run the bot

```sh
npm run dev
```

This runs the application with [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) which automatically restarts the application when changes are made.
